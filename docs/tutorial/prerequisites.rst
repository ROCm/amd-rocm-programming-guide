Prerequisites
=============

To follow this tutorial, you'll need installed drivers and a HIP compiler
toolchain to compile your code. HIP supports compiling and running on Linux and
Windows with AMD GPUs, the combination of install instructions is more than
worth covering as part of this tutorial. For more information about installing
HIP development packages, see :doc:`/install/install`.
